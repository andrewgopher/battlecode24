kiting: minimize attack risk (break ties by distance to allies, distance to enemies)
chasing: if we can't move into attacking range, minimize minimum distance. else, minimize risk while being in attacking range of some enemy
good eval: more combined health than enemy

def kite with eval:
	if in range of enemy, kite
	else if at risk of being attacked by enemy:
		if good eval:
			stay
		else:
			kite

def chase with eval:
	if good eval: #because we will probably end up trading hits, which is only good if we are better
		chase
	else if chasing does not put us at risk of being attacked:
		chase

if attack cooldown < 10:
	if no enemies in range:
		chase with eval
	try attack

	kite with eval
else:
	kite with eval
	if movement cooldown < 10 and not at risk of being attacked:
		if our attack cooldown < 10 next turn:
			chase with eval
		else:
			if chasing does not put us at risk of being attacked, chase
